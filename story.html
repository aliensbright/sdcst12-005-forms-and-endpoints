  <p>Today we went to <label id="pname"> Lake. At (proper name) 
  Lake, we saw a (Aquatic animal). Since I am not scared
   of (Aquatic animal)s, I went to pet it with my hand.
  The (aquatic animal) was very (adjective) when I pet it.
  My friend, (name), on the other hand, felt very (emotion)
   and poked it with their (gardening tool) weapon. The 
   (aquatic animal) ended up (verb in present) us. The end.
